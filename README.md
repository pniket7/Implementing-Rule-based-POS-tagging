# **1. PROJECT NAME:**
- Creating  a Rule based Part-of-Speech tagger

**2. PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

- The script uses a regex-based tagger to assign POS tags to words in a sentence based on a set of predefined rules.
- The rules cover common parts of speech, including articles, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, punctuation, and default nouns.
- A sample sentence is then tested on the model.
